A New Bulls Eye Game
* A new Bull's Eye Game written in Swift for your enjoyment. Slide the circle to get close to the randomly selected number and gain 
extra points. I hope you have fun with it. 

Things to improve:
* Getting an icon for the app itself
* Improving graphics and choices for UI components
* Improve the view of the 'About' page
